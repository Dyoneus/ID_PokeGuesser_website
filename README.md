## Introduction

Do you remember Pokémon GO app? People from all around the world are playing and even people from all ages, even the seniors knows about Pokémon!

This is a site mostly for Pokémon enthusiasts or fans to test their Pokémon knowledge. Silhouettes of random Pokémon will be tossed at the user, with each accurate guess increasing the player's score.

It is created in such a way that the user feels as though they are in a Pokémon battle where they must guess the unknown Pokémon they are battling. It is an interactive design that also allows users to choose their username and gender, which customizes the Pokémon trainer with whom they are battling. 

## Design Process
 
This website application's goal is to build something that Pokémon enthusiasts would like. 

As fellow Pokémon fans, we chose to go with a design that would allow you to enjoy our guessing game with a layout similar to the Pokémon battles of older generation Pokémon franchise. We intended to provide a customizable playing experience because most of us gamers appreciate being able to customize our characters, which is why we included the ability to choose the gender of the Pokémon trainers.

We began with a simple welcome screen that requests your username. This is the point at which Professor Oak asks you for your name, signaling the start of your Pokémon adventure. Following that, they will ask you for your gender, which will also determine which Pokémon trainer you will use in the game. It would then take you to a loading screen before transitioning to the main guessing game.

## Features

In the beginning, users can enter their unique user names to verify identities then get their Pokémon teams. If they don't have existing user names yet, this step will assist them in creating ones. Hovering over buttons will have a sound to make it responsive!

There will be a gender selection screen after user input their desired user names which will then affect the gender of your Pokémon trainer during the battle! 

Loading screen will be shown before a wild Pokémon shows out with shadow! Guess the name and submit it! The system will provide feedback about the answer.
